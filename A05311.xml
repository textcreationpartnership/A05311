         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that I had atchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the enterpriſe of the tranſlation
of this litle booke (right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull) to the end I might communicate,
illuſtrate, and expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the ſame to them which vnderstand not the latine
tongue, aſwell for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the ſtudious reader, as the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Leuinus Lemnius</hi> the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned author: I called to mind
a certain brief &amp; graue poeme of <hi>Rhianus</hi> the Greke poet concerning
the imprudencie &amp; inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of ſome men, whiche cannot moderate their
troublous affections &amp; perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mind with equanimitie, which is a
ſingular vertue &amp; ſoueraign remedie of al griefes incident vnto humane
life: which moderation of mind whoſoeuer wanteth is either puffed vp with
proſperity, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with aduerſity. We, ſaieth that poet, do
erre &amp; iudge amiſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the <pb facs="tcp:28937:3"/> manifold giftes of God,
and receiue them fooliſhly and vnaduiſedlie. For he that is poore &amp;
destitute of liuing, doeth with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, griefe, &amp; heauines of heart, lay
great blame on the determination and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God: but he neglecteth the
vertue, industrie, and apt inclination of his owne mind: neither dare he for
feare ſay or do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing where rich men bee in preſence, but baſhfulnes
&amp; penſiuenes do conſume his heart. Contrariwiſe he which liueth in
proſperitie, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath giuen riches, preeminence, &amp; authority,
ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, beginning, educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and mortalitie:
and eleuating himſelfe with arrogancie and depraued hautines of hart,
thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dereth like <hi>Iupiter:</hi> &amp; though ſomtime he be of little
ſtature, he ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vp his head on high, &amp; with amiable armes
wooeth faire <hi>Minerua,</hi> and ſeeketh to attaine to the top of
<hi>Olympus.</hi> When I had well pondered this pithie poeſie, I was animated
and encouraged therby to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate theſe my little labours &amp;
lucubrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to your worſhip, as a teſtification of my prompt wil, readie
mind, &amp; grateful hart: So that I was diſmaied neither with the
<pb facs="tcp:28937:3"/> conſideration of my poore lowe estate, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the feare
of ſome ſuch highmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the poet here doeth reprehend: who being
aduaunced and adorned with worldly welth, wiſdom, dignity, &amp;
proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, &amp; euery daie expecting and deſiring most exquiſit and
pleaſaunt nouelties, will peraduenture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne this rude, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſhed
peece of worke. Therefore ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame to your fauour and
protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I attempered my penne, not to be plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the learned,
whereunto I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to attaine, but to pleaſe and profite the meane
&amp; vnlearned multitude, which is my only deſire. And although I know there
be an infinite nmber of learned ſtudents, whoſe diligence herein might haue
bene farre more commendable in poliſhing this tranſlation with perfect and
excellent Rhetoricall ſkill, and ſo could haue come nearer to the elegant
stile of the learned author: Yet I thought it better, thus bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rudely,
as I could, to attempt the ſame, then that it ſhouldly hidden from the
vnlearned, for whoſe instruction, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and exhortation it was meete
and requiſite to dinulgate the ſame. For to <pb facs="tcp:28937:4"/> what end is a man
borne &amp; brought forth into the light of this life, but by his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie
to glorifie his Creator, and to benefite his neighbour? He hath liued long
inough whoſoeuer hath liued vnto nature wel and ſufficiently, vnto
himſelfe &amp; his owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation bleſſedly and happily, vnto the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of others profitablie, vnto the glorie of God acceptablie and
thankefully. Hee hath not liued, which hath left no iſſue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of
him, which graffeth not trees for another age to come, and ſo profite his
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie, which ſheweth not ſome good and profitable doctrin vnto the
people that ſhal be born after him. For as we at this day are the better
ſtabliſhed &amp; more ſurely confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the true faith,
becauſe we haue learned and receiued the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our harts of Chriſt,
of his Apoſtles, of the fathers, of the primitiue Church, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of
this last Church, which was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and ſcholler of ſinceritie and

fraile lumpe of earth, which turneth into earth againe. In euery faithfull,
vertuous, and godly Chriſtian the ſoule (which is the higheſt or chiefe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb facs="tcp:28937:8"/> part of the mind or ſpirite or power intellectiue) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led by
the Spirite of God, ought to rule the body and the luſtes, appetites and
deſires therof: And the bodie as a ſeruaunt or miniſter vnto his lord
&amp; mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ought alwaies to be obedient to the good and godly motions of
the Spirite, as the Apoſtle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſaying If ye mortifie the deeds of
the body by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spirite ye ſhall liue. And a little after he ſaieth,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> The ſame Spirite beareth witnes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our

of God: which muſt haue domination ouer the affections, luſtes,
perturbations, will, deſires, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence. For if at any time the
bodie beeing not thus kept in ſubiection, do happen to rebell and make
inſurection againſt the Spirite, and like an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed colte which caſteth
of his rider, do throwe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie the yoke of obedience, and make war againſt
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honeſt, good, godly, &amp; vertuous deſires of the mind, ſurely then
the whole man bothe bodie and ſoule muſt needs run, euen as though he were
caried hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, into all kind of vices, wickednes, and ſin, and ſo
conſequently bee throwne downe into the guife or pit of eternall damnation
and deſtruction. Of this moſt perillous and pernicious fall the Apoſtle
giueth vs a very good and profitable admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaying, Let not ſin reigne
in your mortall bodie, that yee ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof. For
the bodie,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to ſin,
preſſeth downe the ſoule that muſeth of many things, and cloggeth,
darkneth, &amp; dulleth the vnderſtanding, ſo that it cannot lift vp it
ſelfe in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditations and heauenly contemplations. Vnto this place that
precept of <hi>Cicero</hi> ſeemeth not altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnfit to be referred, when

nature the beſt guide of life. In <pb facs="tcp:28937:9"/> theſe two briefe documents
the whole ſumme and ſcope of all morall philoſophie, in my iudgement, may
well be comprehended. For when the gentiles, which haue not the lawe, doe by
nature the things conteined in the law,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> they
hauing not the lawe, are a lawe vnto themſelues, which ſhewe the effect of
the lawe written in their heartes. I feare leſt this may iuſtlie be
ſpoken to our great ſhame in theſe daies, which being profeſſed
Chriſtians, and peyfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the lawe of God, and many of vs
very ſkilfull not onely in humane, but alſo in heauenly, ſacred, and

            <p>And laſtly of morall philoſophie, or doctrine of maners, and

as <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Cicero,</hi> and all other Philoſophers and humane
wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (the reading of whoſe workes were a tedious &amp; infinite labour)
do conteine. In this booke therefore the reader ſhall reape a triple or
threefold commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: namely, the health of bodie, the ſaluation of ſoule,
and the integritie of life, as an inſeparable companion of them both. This
booke is an <hi>Epitome,</hi> that is to ſay, a ſhort ſummarie or
compendious col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of diuine, humane, naturall, and morall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie:
So that in the litle labour of reading the ſame ſtudiouſly, and
meditating and ruminating the preceptes thereof diligently, the reader ſhalbe
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and profited exceedingly. And bicauſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the corruption
of our depraued nature wee are more prone, more inclined, more diligent and

we are admoniſhed, that as the ſoule, being as I ſaid before, a diuine,

wherein the light of the Goſpell ſhineth ſo clearely, to ſee the

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:28937:90"/> and beginneth to come to full ripeneſſe, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
more decent games. But in euery kind of exerciſe that is commodious and

but craft, deceit, guile, ſleight, and ſubtiltie: neither doth
conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, aduiſement or wiſedome take place, but chaunce, fortune,

draughts,<note place="margin">What dice is.</note> caſting of dice out of a

which doe not take heede nor bee circumſpect, are cleane wiped and beguiled

al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſome hope of winning in ſuch exerciſes tickleth a mans mind, and

exerciſe is ordained, and licence to play is permitted, not for the winning
or the getting <pb n="149" facs="tcp:28937:91"/> of gayne thereby, but in reſpect of
health and pleaſant recreation, to the end that the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried mind may haue
ſome reſt, &amp; ſo conceiue new ſtrength to tolerate and ſuſtaine
labours agayne. But it is the nature and condition of dice-players, that
